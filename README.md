# Lube ðŸ˜³

**If you are looking for Krytox or some other lubes/oils go to**

**If you are looking for something cheap**
 - Keyboard Grease: [https://petrelplus.com/-KEYBOARD-GREASES?search=keyboard%20grease](https://petrelplus.com/-KEYBOARD-GREASES?search=keyboard%20grease "https://petrelplus.com/-KEYBOARD-GREASES?search=keyboard%20grease") 
 - Silicone oil :- [https://amzn.to/36O3ZrU](https://amzn.to/36O3ZrU "https://amzn.to/36O3ZrU") ( If you want to thin down the lube or want some lube for the springs)

 ```lubing part 
* Tactile switches :- For a tactile switch your going to want a lubricant that is a lower viscosity. So mix the keyboard grease and the silicone oil in 80/20 weighted quantities, we do so such that we don't loose any tactility on the switch ( also we do not lube the legs on the stem as it diminish the tactility) 
* Linear switches :- Just use the keyboard lube as is but do a light coat for the same, overlubing can cause the switch to feel sluggish and make it unusable ( needs to be cleaned either with a cloth or a ultrasonic cleaner )
* Springs :- So for the springs just use the oil mentioned and use the bag lube method , but if you think bag lubing is inconsistent you can lube each spring using a brush ( consumes time though) 
* Stabs :- For the stabs just use the keyboard lube as it is, It's thick enough to stay on the stabs and does not separate or drip down ( use a lighter coat of lube for the stab stem and thicker one for the stab wire.```

**And Coconut oil, WD-40, Vaseline cannot be used as lube, If you want to try out any other grease don't do the same without reading the datasheet ,lot of these greases are corrosive and not dielectric in nature, which can either spoil the switches or the short the PCB hence causing permanent damage**
